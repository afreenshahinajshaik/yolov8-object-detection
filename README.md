# YOLOv8 Object Detection with Roboflow & Google Colab

This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv8 model, trained on a custom dataset via Roboflow and implemented in Google Colab.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects objects in images using a trained YOLOv8 model
- Custom dataset integration using Roboflow
- Easy-to-use Colab notebook (no setup required)
- Optionally supports real-time webcam prediction

## 📁 Files Included
- `New object detection.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook with training, validation, and prediction code
